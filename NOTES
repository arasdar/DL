# For tensorflow installation
conda install tensorflow <CPU>
conda install tensorflow-GPU <GPU>

# How to update Anaconda -- this was the actual command I typed and worked!
conda update --prefix ~/anaconda3 anaconda

# Please update conda by running
conda update -n base conda

# For numba and cuda-python programming:
sudo apt-get install nvidia-modprobe
This does magic in recognizing the GPU-device in the system!
I don't know how.

# Show the remote origin url
git remote --verbose or -v

# Installing Xcodes for github use or CLI use
# Installing homwbrew as MacOS package manager instead of apt-get

# How to configure git lfs or large file storage in github
Download and install GIT-LFS package/ binaries.
git lfs install
git lfs track <files/folder>
git add <files/folder> with .gitattribute
git commit -m "message related to LFS files"
git push

# I think there may be a potential bug in cloning with git lfs (Still to be determined). 
# You can try this method of fetching the repo, which is in fact faster too:
// Skip smudge - We'll download binary files later in a faster batch
git lfs install --skip-smudge

// Do git clone here
git clone ...

// Fetch all the binary files in the new clone
git lfs pull

// Reinstate smudge
git lfs install --force
This only needs to be done once to initialize the clone for the first time.

# Installing stuff using conda-forge
conda-forge is a github organization containing repositories of conda recipes. 
Thanks to some awesome continuous integration providers (AppVeyor, CircleCI and TravisCI), 
each repository, also known as a feedstock, automatically 
builds its own recipe in a clean and repeatable way on Windows, Linux and OSX.
